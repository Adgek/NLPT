						<div class="nlptfit-blurb">
							<p>While we are mainly known for training athletes. Our approach to training “former athletes” remains the same: assess each individual, prescribe a safe and effective training program, deliver top-notch coaching, and get <b>RESULTS</b>.</p>
							<p>This approach to training is one of our core philosophies at NLPT, and it is the reason why we don’t offer bootcamps, classes, or prescribe general “workouts” for our clients. What’s right for one, might not be right–or safe–for another.</p>
						</div>

						<div class=" nlptfit-blurb">
							<p>On the other side of things, we don’t believe one-on-one personal training is the best approach either. It’s expensive and it’s lonely. Who wants to spend $80 an hour to sweat in front of some dude counting backwards from 10? Sadly that’s what most people go for at commercial gyms. But you don’t <b>WANT</b> personal training. What you want is <b>RESULTS</b>. What you want is professional expertise. What you want is to feel, move, and look better without having to take out a second mortgage on your home.</p>

							<p>So why not have the best of both worlds? Why not train in a fun, competitive environment around other clients such as yourself, while at the same time performing a workout that’s been written for you at a <b>FRACTION</b> of the cost of one-on-one training?</p>

						<p>So how does our gym work? How does a program get written for you? What’s with the nutrition program? Let’s start at the beginning and then go through a typical training day at NLPT.</p>

					<h2>Step #1: The Assessment</h2>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-md-6 ">
							<div class="purpose">
								<p>The purpose of the assessment is twofold:
									<ul>
										<li>To screen for health and injury risk (so we can program accordingly)</li>
										<li>To assess the information that matters to you so we can track whether or not your training is successful.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="quote">
								<blockquote>"But coach, I have a bum shoulder!"</blockquote>
								<p>No problem. We can still train <b>AROUND</b> it and work <b>WITH</b> your medical professional so that your training program blends with and enhances your rehabilitation program.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-6">
							<div class="assessment">
								<p>Included in everyone’s assessment is:
									<ul>
										<li>Functional Movement Screen which screens for movement dysfunction and possible sources of injury</li>
										<li>Before photos</li>
										<li>Weight</li>
										<li>Body composition / measurements (may include body fat analysis or girth measurements)</li>
										<li>Health and injury history.</li>
										<li>Fitness measurements (dependent on the trainee)</li>
										<li>Nutrition evaluation</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="step2 col-md-6 ">
							<h2>Step #2: Program Design</h2>
							<div class="design">
								<p>Taking this information, we then go about designing your plan. For as long as you are a client at NLPT, you will be written a 4-week training program. Each time you complete one, you automatically get another.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="considerations">
								<p>Programs are written with the following considerations:
									<ul>
										<li><b>How often can you train per week?</b> <small>Want to start slow with a 2-day a week program? Ready to get after it with 5-days a week?</small></li>
										<li><b>Are there any movement limitations you have?</b> <small>Low back pain? There are going to be some exercises (for now) that just aren’t going to be in your plan. Sorry.</small></li>
										<li><b>What’s your training-age?</b> <small> Is this your first time training or have you been at it for the last 10 years?</small></li>
										<li><b>What do you like to do?</b> <small>Yes you have some input here too! Want to try Olympic lifting? We’ll coach you through it the right way. Do you like circuit-style training? We’ll program it the right way so it’s safe and still fits in with your goals.</small></li>
									</ul>
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-6">
							<div class="step3">
								<h2>Step #3: Time to Train</h2>
								<div class="train">
									<p>All the prep work is done and it’s time to get started. No appointments necessary, just come visit us during one of our designated adult training times, grab your program and get to work. A qualified NLPT coach is always on site to coach you through the exercises and give you a kick in the butt (when needed)!
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="step4">
								<h2>Step #4: Re-assess and repeat</h2>
								<div class="re-assess">
									<p>Is this actually working? Are you feeling better? Are you losing weight or gaining muscle? The re-assessment is just as crucial as the initial assessment since it is our way of monitoring progress. Of course we want to give you a killer “workout”, but we also want to keep our eye on the bigger picture and make sure you are actually getting the results you signed up for. Re-assessments are done at our monthly Combine Day, which is held on the first Saturday of each month.
