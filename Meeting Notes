Meeting Notes:

Overall thoughts
- Alot of information all of it is good, so need to decide if this is ok, or if you want to cut down on the amount.
	-if cut down on the amount will I believe make the site look more clean, though will need a little redesign.

- BLOGS
	-how do we want to do this?
	-i like the idea of having every coach be an author, so on the blog page there will be a "most recent" or click on author to see thier posts.
	-API?
	-this also effects the recent blog posts on the home page, and maybe even Events.
- Events
	-Is this a blog? or something just updated behind the scenes?
		-quick message? or verbose?

-NLPTathlete
	-site gives a blog post by Zach, i'm assuming thats not what needs to go there.

-Anything that it's missing?
	-videos?
	-contact us form to email?
	-extra pages?

Individual Page notes

HomePage
- Polish color on whats new page
- Is what's new page what the want.

NLPTfit
-alot of text/ content
-once content is settled upon then better themed pictures to content goes up.
-is Program Details the best title for that bottom section.
-bolded the words that were capitalized. but some seem unnessesary

NLPTteam
-alot of text / content
-last section be able to maybe make a table of prices and what the recieve?
	-only one option shows price
	-flex option is sort of unclear

NLPTyouth
-first section needs more text, with picture not centered.
	-put how to get started there temporarily


NLPTrehab
-no pictures (not even dummy ones)


About
- should have a "history" little blurb for this page.
	-"i always loved working out etc....etc...."
- agian need photos
	-maybe black and white, or old hopf photo?

Meet the Staff
- Once JS is up and running will polish to have photo fade and name appear
	-or can include names over the pictures on second thought.

-everyone is Hopfs page as he when the JS is up will make it easy to switch between and other staff can be added.

Contact
- just need wanted ways of communicating... fax? LinkdIn? etc...
